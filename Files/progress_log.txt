--- SUMMARY OF WORK ---
[9/2/25]
 - Updated functionality for GUI of maths_game
 - Included user input area


--- FEATURES IN PROGRESS ---
- [9/2/25] - Adding GUI functionality with TKinter, updating labels, accepting user input

--- COMPLETED FEATURES ---
- [9/2/25] - User input box and associated function


--- BUG TRACKING ---


--- IDEAS FOR IMPROVEMENT ---
- [9/2/25] - Add a logging function to act as a check for how your code is executing. Will this slow the program down if you're logging everything?


--- CHALLENGES & DEBUGGING NOTES ---


--- QUESTIONS TO FOLLOW UP ON ---
- [2/2/25] - print(' ', num, '\n+', num2)  # This prints the 2 random numbers and aligns them in the output, using the add operator. Ask Chat for explaination on what is happening here
- [9/2/25] - math_frame.place(relx=0.5, rely=0.5, anchor="center")  # Centering the frame, unsure how this works
- [9/2/25] - label2.grid(row=0, column=1, sticky="e")  # Top number. # Not sure how this works, especially sticky and also general placement of element - how could I shift the values up more? Or move them around on the page?
- [9/2/25] - #label.pack(expand=True)  # Center the label - Not sure what this means in terms of working with labels
- [9/2/25] - label2.grid(row=0, column=1, sticky="e")  # Top number - How can I shift this up more within the window?
- [9/2/25] - Unsure about the full mechanics of the user input box
- [11/2/25] - Unsure about this code withing get_user_input(), if user_answer.isdigit() and int(user_answer) == num + num2:. Is this checking against the user entering not a number?
